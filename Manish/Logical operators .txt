* only static method  can be call by its name. static method will have modifier as static.

* how to invoked non-static method.

* Non-static method  can be call by object name. Non-static method will have modifier as Non-static.
 //create an object
 syntax of creating object
 classname variable_name = new classname();

*  we can create object anywhere but creating object is inside one method is no use.
* always create object inside main method because main method can call the method.

* 1. in my program there are two method one static and other non-static
static method call by method name
non-static can be call by creating object of reference varible.
but can we call static method by the object of non-static method.

2.For non-static method how we create object of reference varible for single method?
