Access Specifier for class

public               permitted
protected            you cant have it
default/package      permitted
private              you cant have it

what do u mean by a class being public?
it can accessed within the package also  (scanner class, System class)
outside the package also


what do u mean by a class being package/default?
it can accessed within the package  (scanner class, System class)
not outside the package 

if class is accessible then you can use other class methods.


** Interface
interface is use to create abstract method which helps us to achieve abstraction.

*two types of method
1.concrete method
2.abstract method

1.concrete method - concrete method are those method which will have method body.
		    ex: void add()
			{
			int a= 10;
			system.out.println(a);	

			}
 and those method we are learning from day 1.

2.abstract method - abstract method are those method which will have no method body.(empty methods)
		   ex: void add();

**1.concrete class - concrete class are those class which will only have concrete method body.

** 2.Abstract class - abstarct class are those class which can have both concrete and abstract method body.

* abstract method facts.
1.Every abstract method needs to non-static
2.Every abstract method needs to overriding.
