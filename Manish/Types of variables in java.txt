* Types of variables in java
  i.  Local variable
  ii. Global variable
  iii. Final variable

* Local variable
 - Any variable that is declare inside the method is called as local variable
 example/syntax 
 - inside the method means(non static, static, main, main method, constructor para or non-para)
 void add()
	{
		int a = 1;
	}
static void sub()
	{
		int a = 1;
		string name = "Manish"
	}
 - local variable cannot be distinguish between static and non-static i.e( static int a, non-static int b)
 - local variable does not have a default value you have to initialize.
 - local variable cannot utilize until and unless it is initialized.
   declaration   int a;
   initialization a = 10;
   utilization     println(a);
 - scope of local variable will be from staring of method till the end of method.
 - brown  in color is a local variable.


* Global variable
 - Any variable that is declare outside any method but inside the class is called as global variable.
 - syntax
  class One
  {
  int a=100; //global 
  double b=9.09 //global
  void add()
  {
  int salary = 9000;//local 
  }
  main()
  {
  String name="Manish";//local
  }
 
 }
 - global variable can be distinguish between static and non-static.
 - global variable have a default value.
   double,float = 0
   Boolean = false
   string = null
   char-not defined
 - global variable can be utilize without initialized.
 - Scope of global variable will be from beginning of the class till the end of class.
 - int a=100; // declare and initialize in a single line.

* Final variable
syntax of final variable inside main method

void add()
{
final int min=60;//local variable
}
final static double pi=3.14//global as final

** facts of final keyword
- final-variable --> value can't be changed
- final method   --> no one can override it
- final-class    --> no one can inherit it

** Math class
- predefined class in java 
- present under java lang package.
- it is present in java lang package 
- we can perform any mathematic operation.
