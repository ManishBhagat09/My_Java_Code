* Final variable
 - any local and global variable can be final in nature.
 - any local where which is final will not change its value throughout the method.
 - any global where which is final will not change its value through out the class.
 - variable being final means value cannot be change
 - for any universal truth  we can use final variable concept (1 min = 60 sec, 1 hour = 60 mint, 1 km = 1000 m)
 - syntax of final variable inside the method
   void add()
   {
   final int min=60;//local variable
   }
   class One
   {
   final static double pi=3.14;//global variable
   main()
   {
   
   }
   }

* facts of final keyword
- final keyword can be use for variable --> value can't be changed
- final keyword can be use for method   --> no one can override it (
- final keyword can be use for class    --> no can inherit it

* Math class

- predefined class we have in java 
- present under java lang package.
- it is present in java lang package it can use directly without importing. 
- we can perform any mathematic operation.
- anything coming from java lang package we don't need to import it.(System.out.println)
- we can perform any mathematical operation( add, sub, mul, div, greatest of two number, pi value)
- how you can utilize method : math.method


- (Math.random() //for generating unique value between 0 and 1.
- System.out.println(Math.random());     //Always generate random number between 0 and 1 
- while performing test case and test scenario (to save screenshot with unique no we use Math.random)

* Math.random -- return type is double
- Returns a double value with a positive sign, greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.Returned values 
- returns a double value upto 17 digit because return type is double.

* Global variable of math class
 double pi = Math.PI;   //static final variable

* Loops in Java

- loops means iterations

* Syntax of for loop
 for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement operator)
{


}

increment i++;  --> increment value by 1
decrement i--;  --> decrement value by 1

* lets print your name 2 times
* lets print 1 to 10
* lets print 1 to 50
* find out area of circle by using for loop where r is coming math.random and pi is coming from math.pi and area circle will print 10 times
* math.random generate random values
